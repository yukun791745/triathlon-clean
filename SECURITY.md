# Security Policy

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly via GitHub Issues or by contacting the maintainer `@yukun791745`.

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities if you prefer private disclosure; instead, contact the maintainer directly.

We will triage and respond as quickly as possible.
